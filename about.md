 The purpose of this website is to give you a comprehensive introduction to Computer Science. This means we not only cover programming or coding, but also cover overall concepts of computer sience and real life application.

<p>
 We are going to focus on fundamental computer theories and problem solving which relate with competitive programming.

Today, competitive programming is more popular than ever. The Internet has
played a significant role in this progress. There is now an active online community of competitive programmers, and many contests are organized every week. At the same time, the difficulty of contests is increasing. Techniques that only the very best participants mastered some years ago are now standard tools known by a large number of people. Competitive programming has its roots in the scientific study of algorithms. However, while a computer scientist writes a proof to show that their algorithm works, a competitive programmer implements their algorithm and submits it to a contest system. Then, the algorithm is tested using a set of test cases, and if it passes all of them, it is accepted. This is an essential element in competitive programming, because it provides a way to automatically get strong evidence that an algorithm works. In fact, competitive programming has proved to be an excellent way to learn
algorithms, because it encourages to design algorithms that really work, instead of sketching ideas that may work or not.

 Another benefit of competitive programming is that contest problems require
thinking. In particular, there are no spoilers in problem statements. This is actually a
severe problem in many algorithms courses. You are given a nice problem to solve,
but then the last sentence says, for example: “Hint: modify Dijkstra’s algorithm to
solve the problem.” After reading this, there is not much thinking needed, because
you already know how to solve the problem. This never happens in competitive
programming.
