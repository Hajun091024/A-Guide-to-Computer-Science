 The purpose of this website is to give you a comprehensive introduction to Computer Science. This means we not only cover programming or coding, but also cover overall concepts of computer sience and real life application.
</p>

<p>
 We are going to focus on fundamental computer theories and problem solving which relate with competitive programming.

Today, competitive programming is more popular than ever. The Internet has
played a significant role in this progress. There is now an active online community of competitive programmers, and many contests are organized every week. At the same time, the difficulty of contests is increasing. Techniques that only the very best participants mastered some years ago are now standard tools known by a large number of people. Competitive programming has its roots in the scientific study of algorithms. However, while a computer scientist writes a proof to show that their algorithm works, a competitive programmer implements their algorithm and submits it to a contest system. Then, the algorithm is tested using a set of test cases, and if it passes all of them, it is accepted. This is an essential element in competitive programming, because it provides a way to automatically get strong evidence that an algorithm works. In fact, competitive programming has proved to be an excellent way to learn
algorithms, because it encourages to design algorithms that really work, instead of sketching ideas that may work or not.

 Another benefit of competitive programming is that contest problems require
thinking. In particular, there are no spoilers in problem statements. This is actually a
severe problem in many algorithms courses. You are given a nice problem to solve,
but then the last sentence says, for example: “Hint: modify Dijkstra’s algorithm to
solve the problem.” After reading this, there is not much thinking needed, because
you already know how to solve the problem. This never happens in competitive
programming.

Instead, you have a full set of tools available, and you have to figure
out yourself which of them to use.
Solving competitive programming problems also improves one’s programming
and debugging skills. Typically, a solution is awarded points only if it correctly
solves all test cases, so a successful competitive programmer has to be able to
implement programs that do not have bugs. This is a valuable skill in software
engineering, and it is not a coincidence that IT companies are interested in people
who have background in competitive programming.
It takes a long time to become a good competitive programmer, but it is also an
opportunity to learn a lot. You can be sure that you will get a good general
understanding of algorithms if you spend time reading the book, solving problems,
and taking part in contests.

I am very grateful to a large number of people who have sent me feedback on
draft versions of this book. This feedback has greatly improved the quality of the
book. I especially thank Mikko Ervasti, Janne Junnila, Janne Kokkala, Tuukka
Korhonen, Patric Östergård, and Roope Salmi for giving detailed feedback on the
manuscript. I also thank Simon Rees and Wayne Wheeler for excellent collaboration
when publishing this book with Springer.
