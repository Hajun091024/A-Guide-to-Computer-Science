## Explanation
The question is:
There is an array (A) of N elements. We need to find the number of partial sums that equal to K.\
(a partial sum is the sum of elements between A[i]~A[j])

the input is like
```
N K
A
```
the output is 
```
the number of partial sums that equal to K
```

For example, let's look at the sample input:

```
4 0
2 -2 2 -2
```

The output is 
```
4
```
there are (1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(1,2,3,4)
which are (2,-2),(-2,2),(2,-2),(2,-2,2,-2)

since there are $\mathcal(N*(N+1)/2)$ partial sums, 
it would be too slow for us to calculate all of them.
I used python dictionary to solve this.
There is only one value needed to calculate how many sums equal to K, which is K-A[i] 

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$ \
**Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```py
#2015
from sys import stdin, stdout,setrecursionlimit

#input
setrecursionlimit(10**7)
input = stdin.readline

l,k = map(int,input().split())
arr = list(map(int,input().split()))

# can is the dictionary showing all the partial sums till now 
can = {0:1}

#cnt is count which is the awnser
add = cnt = 0
for n in arr:
    add += n
    need = add - k
    
    #if there is a element if the dictionary we need:
    if can.get(need) != None:
        cnt += can[need]
    
    #add n to the dictionary
    if can.get(add) != None:
        can[add] += 1
    else:
        can.update({add:1})

print(cnt)
```
