## Explanation
The question is:
there are many ways to write brackets
it can be like (()(( or it can be (()())()
a closed bracket can not be like (() or ())(
print YES if it is a closed bracket and NO if it is not.

There are T test cases

the input is like
```
T
each test case seperated by a line
```
the output is 
```
YES or NO for each test case seperated by a line
```

For example, let's look at the sample input:

```
6
(())())
(((()())()
(()())((()))
((()()(()))(((())))()
()()()()(()()())()
(()((())()(
```

The output is 
```
NO
NO
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

If the number of ( does not equal to the number of ), then it is not closed
If a ) comes before ( then it is not closed

## Implementation

N if the lenth of each string
**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(T*N)$ \
**Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(T)$

```py
#input
from sys import stdin
input = stdin.readline

awn = ''

for i in range(int(input())):
    #for each test case
    n = input()
    cnt = 0
    
    for i in n:
        if i == '(': cnt += 1
        if i == ')': cnt -= 1
        #if cnt < 0 then if means ) came before ( 
        if cnt < 0: break
    # if cnt > 0 it means that there are more ( than )
    # so cnt need to be 0 to make the bracket closed
    if cnt: awn += 'NO\n'
    else: awn += 'YES\n'
print(awn[:-1])
```
