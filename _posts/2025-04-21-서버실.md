## Explanation
The question is:
There are $\mathcal N ^ 2$ places for computers. Every place contains 0~10,000,000 computers in stacks.
Every time you turn on the cooler, one floor of the computers are turned on. What is the least amount of times you need to turn on the cooler so that at least half of the computers are on?


For example, let's look at the sample input:

```
5
1 4 0 2 1
0 0 5 6 3
8 4 7 2 0
7 1 0 5 3
4 5 7 9 1
```

The output is 
```
3
```
If we turn on the cooler 3 times, 50 computers are on.
There are 85 computers in total. so all you need to do is to turn on the cooler 3 times. 

I used the binary seach algorithm to solve this problem.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log(\max(I)))$ \
Where I is the biggest number of computers on one pile\
**Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```py
from sys import stdin
input = stdin.readline

#get the input
n = int(input())

#put all the elements on one list
l = []
for i in range(n):
    l += list(map(int,input().strip().split()))


all = sum(l)
#our goal
half = all//2 + bool(all%2)

#if n is the number of times you turned on the cooler
#cnt is how many computers are on
def number(n):
    cnt = 0
    for i in l:
        if i > n: cnt += n
        else:
            cnt += i
    return cnt

# do the binary search
a,b = 0,max(l)
while a < b:
    mid = (a+b)//2
    cnt = number(mid)

    if cnt < half:
        a = mid+1
    else:
        b = mid
print(b)
```
