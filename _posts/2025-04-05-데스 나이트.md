## Explanation
The question is:

There is a new knight called death knight.
If the death knight is at (r,c) it can only go to 
(r-2, c-1), (r-2, c+1), (r, c-2), (r, c+2), (r+2, c-1), (r+2, c+1)

If the death knight is at (r1,c1) 
how many times does it have to move to go to (r2,c2)?

The input is like

n\
r1 c1 r2 c2

For example, let's look at the sample input:

```
4
1 6 4 6
```

The output is 
```
4
```


I used the BFS algorithm to calculate how many times the knight has to move.\
Since N(5 ≤ N ≤ 200), we don’t have to worry about the time complexly very much.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N ^ 2)$ \
**Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N ^ 2)$

```py
#import deque and fast input
from collections import deque
from sys import stdin,stdout
input = stdin.readline

#get the input
n = int(input())
r,c,mr,mc = map(int,input().split())

#to do BFS, prepare
went = [[False for i in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
go = deque([[r,c]])
cnt = -1; awn = -1

#the movements the knight can make
gor = [-2,-2,0,0,2,2]
goc = [-1,1,-2,2,-1,1]

#start the bfs
while len(go)>0:
    
    #count
    cnt += 1
    
    for _ in range(len(go)):
        
        r,c = go.pop()
       
        if went[r][c]: continue
        went[r][c] = True
       
        #if it arrived
        if r == mr and c == mc:
            awn = cnt; go.clear(); break
        
        #make the movements
        for i in range(6):
            wr,wc = r+gor[i],c+goc[i]
            
            #if it is on the board
            if -1 < wr < n and -1 < wc < n:
                go.appendleft([wr,wc])
#print
print(awn)
```
